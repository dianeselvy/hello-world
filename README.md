# hello-world

Hey there!

I specialize in graphic design, website design & development, logo design, SEO and brand development. I'm fluent in HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript (jQuery). Currently, I'm finishing up my AAS-T degree in Web Development, and my Certificate in Web Design, which will be complete by Spring of 2017.
I've worked on miscellaneous projects ranging from icon design and redlines to handbook design and production, but currently I work as a concierge and freelance web designer/developer, managing sites and developing brands for small businesses in Seattle.
